# Gluon Erlang Abstract Machine

A configurable and small virtual machine which runs bytecode derived from and 
very similar to Erlang BEAM. VM runtime is rebuilt for features of your code to
be as small as possible. The goal is to go smaller than several tens of kilobytes 
(oh well, under megabyte would be cool).

##  apps/asm &mdash; assembler tool

Assembler tool which takes form of BEAM asm source (built with `erlc -S file.erl`),
parses it and writes either gluonvm binary (GLEAM) or intermediate representation
(IR).

It is designed to track features used by your code and allows you to specify those
features you really want in your VM. Error will generated if code uses something
over your requirements.

Building apps/asm: dependencies: rebar3. Run: `test/test.sh` to compile test module.
Then run: `make asm` to convert S source to gleam binary.

## emulator/

C++ implementation of minimalistic like-BEAM virtual machine. Has simple configurable
feature settings in `include/g_defs.h` (like distribution, float, bignum support etc).

Build with cmake (run `cmake_linux.sh`, then in `_build/` directory run `make`). 
`CMakeLists.txt` work with QtCreator as IDE not to mention cmake supporting host of
other IDEs.

## apps/emuemu and apps/prototype &mdash; attempts to make an emu prototype

A high level interpreter for GluonVM intermediate representation (IR), which
simulates properties of Erlang VM (memory, instruction set, etc) and processes
(registers, stack, process execution state) and allows to run some beam code.

apps/prototype is based on github.com/tonyrog/beam (owe a beer to Tony!)

Building emuemu: dependencies: rebar3. Run: `make emu`
