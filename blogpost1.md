# Gluon VM - Virtual machine for BEAM

## Features

*  Runs BEAM bytecode -- Erlang, Elixir, LFE, Joxa, you name it.
*  Single core -- simple!
*  Optional features -- small!
*  Written in standard modern C++ -- platform independent.
*  Clean source, modern standard (C++11 and C++14 both are in use). Avoiding complex code constructs.
*  Zero abstraction cost principle -- decorated and strictly typed and checked C++ code does not affect resulting machine code in a significant way. Although positively affects code quality.
